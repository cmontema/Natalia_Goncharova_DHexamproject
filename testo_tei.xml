				<date when="1954" calendar="Gregorian">1954</date>, theirs were among the designs that have stood the test of tme most successfully. Few people will now remember their contribution to

				<name type="person">Larionov</name> was not mentioned in the first edition of the catalogue, it arrived during the exhibition and was included in the second or

			<p>The work of 
				<name type="person">Natalie Goncharova</name> is at times very close to that of 
				<name>Larionov</name>, particularly during the 
				<date from="1913" to="1914">
					<rs type="artistic movement">rayonist</rs> period
				</date>, but shows a stronger decorative trait and more dependence on 
				<rs type="artistic movement">Byzantine</rs> and 
				<rs type="artistic movement">Oriental</rs> inspiration. The daughter of an architect, she spent her summers with a grandmother in the 
				<rs type="place">country</rs>, and the deep religious influences of her childhood remained an important factor in her artistic development. She began as a sculptor under 
				<name type="person">Paul Troubetskoy</name> and met 
				<name type="person">Larionov</name> while modelling animals at the 
				<address>zoo</address>. Her early paintings were mostly of peasant subjects and religious compositions. She, too, got into difficulties with officialdom in 
				<name type="place">Moscow</name> and was not permitted to show her religious paintings and at the exhibition entitled 
				<title>'The Ass's Tail'</title>. 
				<rs type="artistic movement">Cubism</rs> amde an immediate appeal to her, as it reminded her of Scynthian stone figures and the carve and painted wooden toys sold at Russian fairs. She claimed to be one of the pioneers of cubist painting in 
				<name type="place">Russia</name>. The process of abstraction is clearly shown in two pictures of 
				<emph rend="italic">Roses</emph>. The first, still in the artist's possession, is a straight-forward painting of a bunch of yellow roses in a glass jug with the back of a canvas behind. In a later version, dated 
				<date when="1905" calendar="Gregorian">1912</date> (

				</rs>), the flowers have been concentrated into one mass of intense glowing orange-yellow, set of by planes of black and deep green. The rose-leaf pattern has been carried into the background, across the stretcher, and the glass and water have been separeted, forming a cascade-like theme on the left. Technical experiments interested her as much as formal inventions. Her brush-work shows great variety, including methods borrowd from house and sign painters, as in the splashed-on white reflections in
